title: UK Parliament closes TikTok account after China data warning
author: 36

content: The UK Parliament has closed down its TikTok account after MPs raised concerns about the risk of data being passed to the Chinese government.
description: The account has been locked, and content deleted, days after its launch.  Senior MPs and peers had called for the account to be removed until TikTok gave "credible assurances" no data could be handed to China.  TikTok is owned by Chinese company ByteDance, which has denied it was controlled by the Chinese government.  Relations between London and Beijing have been fraught in recent years, with tensions heightened by China's sanctioning of several MPs last year.  "Based on member feedback, we are closing the pilot UK Parliament TikTok account earlier than we had planned," a UK Parliament spokesman said.  "The account was a pilot initiative while we tested the platform as a way of reaching younger audiences with relevant content about Parliament."  A TikTok spokeswoman told the BBC it was "disappointing" that Parliament would not be able to connect with users of the app in the UK.  Offering to reassure the MPs who raised concerns, the spokeswoman said TikTok would be willing to "clarify any inaccuracies about our platform".

title: UK interest rates: How does a rise affect me?
author: 36
category_id: 4
content: Interest rates have been raised for the sixth time in a row from 1.25% to 1.75%.
description: The Bank of England's decision to increase rates by half a percentage point makes it the largest increase for 27 years.  The move is an attempt to slow the rate at which prices are rising. The Bank has warned that inflation could pass 13% later this year.  The last time interest rates were this high was during the global financial crisis in December 2008.  Why does raising interest rates help lower inflation? Prices are going up quickly worldwide, as Covid restrictions have been eased and consumers spend more.  Many firms have problems getting enough goods to sell. And with more buyers chasing too few goods, prices have risen.  There has also been a very sharp rise in oil and gas costs - a problem made worse by Russia's invasion of Ukraine.  Why are prices rising so quickly? One way to try to control rising prices - or inflation - is to raise interest rates.  This increases the cost of borrowing and encourages people to borrow and spend less. It also encourages people to save more.  However, it is a tough balancing act as the Bank does not want to slow the economy too much.  Since the global financial crisis of 2008, UK interest rates have been at historically low levels. Last year, they were as low as 0.1%.  How high could interest rates go? Many analysts have predicted UK interest rates will rise this month, but further increases are also expected later in the year.  Analysts at Capital Economics think the Bank will ultimately have to lift rates to 3% to quash inflation, but other economists think they won't have to go so high. Pantheon Macroeconomics reckon interest rates will peak at 1.75%.  Last year, the Office for Budgetary Responsibility (OBR) - the government's independent economic adviser - looked at what might happen if the UK were to experience higher and longer lasting inflation.  This can happen when people think price rises will continue - businesses raise prices to keep making a profit and workers demand wage increases to keep up.

title: Rishi Sunak and Liz Truss row over recession warning in latest TV clash

content: Ms Truss reiterated her pledge to immediately reverse April's increase in National Insurance and cut other taxes, which she claimed would stimulate economic growth and prevent a recession.
description: Tory leadership rivals Rishi Sunak and Liz Truss have set out competing plans to deal with the economic recession - forecast by the Bank of England - in their latest TV clash.  Mr Sunak said Ms Truss's "unfunded" tax cuts would pour "fuel on the fire" of inflation.  But Ms Truss said a recession was "not inevitable" if "bold" action was taken.  The Bank's gloomy forecast of a recession this year loomed large in the TV special, hosted by Sky News.  It earlier raised interest rates to the highest level in almost three decades, from 1.25% to 1.75%, in an attempt to push back skyrocketing prices.  The inflation rate is forecast to hit a 42-year high of 13% this year, while the UK economy is expected to shrink for more than a year.  The Bank said the main reason for high inflation and low growth is rising energy bills, driven by Russia's invasion of Ukraine.  The worsening state of the UK economy has dominated the Tory leadership campaign, with both candidates putting forward rival visions to deal with the fallout.

content: UK hiring slowing down amid economic uncertainty
description: Hiring in the UK has slowed amidst uncertainty over the economy, according to a report.  July saw the slowest increase in the number of permanent jobs filled for 17 months.  KPMG said recruiters are becoming more tentative over hiring new staff.  The consultancy added that ongoing skills shortages, a drop in foreign workers and hesitancy from candidates to move jobs had all led to a tighter supply of suitable staff.  The slowing down of the hiring spree that followed the pandemic comes as the Bank of England warned the UK will fall into recession in the final quarter of this year. The bank raised interest rates from 1.25% to 1.75%, in a bid to curb soaring prices.  The jobs report by KPMG and the Recruitment and Employment Confederation suggested rising operating costs and uncertainty over the UK's economic outlook is leading some firms to put the brakes on recruitment, at least for permanent roles.  But the soaring cost of living and tougher competition for a smaller pool of qualified candidates has also meant that the rate of starting pay continued to rise in July.  "The trend of uncertainty in the UK jobs market of the last few months continues," said KPMG's Claire Warnes.  "Employers are rightly hesitant about their hiring plans... So, a focus on up-skilling existing workers and attracting talent, remains absolutely essential for UK business to play its part in driving forward the economy."  It is still a good time to be a jobseeker - the number of vacancies advertised has continued to grow. Although the fastest rate of growth in vacancies was for temporary posts in the hospitality sector.  "Given the outlook being painted by the Bank of England... one might wonder why anyone would consider switching jobs at all," said Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets.  "Consumer confidence is already at record lows, and prices look set to rise further, so business and consumers are likely to face further challenges. Let's see what the government has in mind to help navigate us through the winter months."  The Bank of England said it expects the economy to shrink in the final three months of this year, and keep shrinking until the end of 2023, signalling the longest downturn for the UK economy since the 2008 financial crisis.  Jeevun Sandher, economist at Kings College London said "those who are able and willing to work are, generally, working. That is great news". But he added: "The problem we face is that having a job does not mean you will earn enough to escape poverty. Even before this cost-of-living crisis, almost 70% of adults in poverty lived in working households. That has gotten significantly worse - half of us are now cutting back on food."  He added that workers should be asking for "the highest salaries possible".
